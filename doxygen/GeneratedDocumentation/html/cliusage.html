<h1><a class="anchor" name="CliUsage">Command Line Prompt Usage</a></h1>For a detailed description of the CLI commands, see the <b><em>DICE Firmware CLI Reference</em></b>.<p>
The DICE Firmware Command Line Interface (CLI) allows developers to manually configure functions in the DICE. The table in the DICE Firmware CLI Reference document gives a brief description of each CLI command. <br>
<p>
<hr>
 <h2>Syntax </h2>
<p>
CLI commands, variables and parameters are case-sensitive. For example, <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; echo On
</pre></div> will result in a parameter error, and <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; echo on
</pre></div> should be used. <br>
<p>
Commands that have subfunctions are separated with either a period ‘<b>.</b>’ or a colon ‘<b>:</b>’ <br>
<p>
For example, the following commands are equivalent: <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; lhl.br
&gt; lhl:br 
</pre></div><p>
<h2>Built-in commands </h2>
<p>
Note that “<b>built-in</b>” does not need to be typed in the command-line when using commands in this category. However, all other categories require that the category name be typed as part of the command line, for example <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">&gt; dal.start 0
</pre></div><p>
<h2>Optional commands </h2>
<p>
Not all commands listed here are available in all DICE Applications. The available commands depend on which build options are set in the firmware when the application is made. <br>
<p>
The table below indicates which target and additional flags are necessary to enable the command if it is not enabled by default. <br>
<p>
In general each module has its own CLI tool <b>#define</b>. For example, to enable to CLI tools for the <b>pb</b> module, define <b>_CLI_TOOL_PB</b> in <b>cliToolDefs. h</b> <br>
<p>
Also see <b>Make.params</b>, and <b>#defines</b> in the source code, to determine which modules are used. For example, if the application is built with the <b>_DICE_DRIVER</b> driver model, then the “<b>avc</b>” and related CLI commands such as “<b>panel</b>” are not available. <br>
<p>
The CLI can be removed altogether to save memory requirements in production applications by removing the <b>_CLI</b> flag in <b>Make.params</b>. <br>
<p>
<h2>Command-line editing </h2>
<p>
The CLI saves your last 9 commands in its history buffer. You can recall previous commands using the up/down arrow keys, and you can edit the command line as well. Note that you must use a serial terminal program that supports sending terminal keys to recall commands. HyperTerminal does not support this, although HyperTerminal PE and many other programs do. <br>
<p>
For a detailed description of the CLI commands, see the <b><em>DICE Firmware CLI Reference</em></b>. <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
